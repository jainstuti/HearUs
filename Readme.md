# Introducing "Hear Us"
### A multi-utility platform for the speech and hearing impaired regain their financial independence.

## The Problem
- Today India alone is home to 63 million people who are suffering either complete or partial deafness, and of these, at least 50 lakh are children. The deaf and speech disabled still remain invisible at institutions of higher education and some of them even fail to complete schooling. Even today, there are only about 700 schools in India that provide education of sign language, and the acceptance of sign language is very low.

- Lack of education among these differently-abled people forces them to stay away from mainstream and take up jobs unlike any other person. This ultimately forces them to stay in the vicious cycle of poverty and lead their lives by being dependent on others.

- Even after massive development in various technologies, still there is unavailability of technological solutions that bridge the gap between them and the mainstream people, in terms of career prospects and skill development. Most of the products available today are made only to meet the needs of a normal person. Even with the massive growth in tech, the opportunities available to them today are still very limited.

## The Solution

In order to empower the speech and hearing impaired people to pursue their interests and build their careers, we have come up with **"Hear Us"**, which is a multi-utility platform for education and job hunt, specifically designed to meet the needs of speech and hearing impaired. Following are the key features of our web-app.

### Key Features
1. **Real-time ASL captions in video calls:**
A place for conducting online interviews or classes for the hearing impaired through video calling. English subtitles will be generated for the message conveyed through American Sign Language (ASL) by the candidate. And the English message from the interviewer will be converted to the equivalent ASL.

2. **ASL subtitles for video:**
Feature to generate subtitles in ASL for any video (in English).

3. **Interactive Learning:**
A platform to learn ASL with practical exposure. A random word will be generated and the user has to perform the equivalent ASL for the same. The probability indicators will indicate the extent of correctness of the ASL action performed for the word. Also, if the user forgets the ASL equivalent of the given word, they could see the hint.

4. **Job Discovery Portal:**
To find and apply for recent openings specifically for the hearing impaired.

## Societal Impact

1. We estimate that once our solution is adopted by the society, it will help those 5 million children to receive quality education post which they can take up jobs of their choice.

2. Through the use of the platform their visibility among the recruiters will increase, thus the platform acts as a bridge between the qualified candidates and the recruiters.

3. This will help them to lead a life closer to the mainstream society.
